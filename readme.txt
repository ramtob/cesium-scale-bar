A Scale Bar for a Cesium map
Based on https://community.cesium.com/t/distance-scale-indicator/10371/11?

The application needs to be run on a web server.
You can install a local web server e.g. `http-server` via npm.
Then run `http-server` from the console, at the project root.
Then open a browser at http://localhost:8080/scaleBar.html
